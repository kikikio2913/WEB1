PersonalityEdit<br>
Everyone's childhood crush. What's not to love about Doi-sensei? A kind-hearted and good-natured teacher who is warm, yet strict with his students. He is well loved by the 1st year Ha class, as well as most nintamas and staff at Ninjutsu Academy. He often gets headaches and stomachaches due to his students' poor academic performances.</p>

Relationships Edit<br>
Kirimaru Settsuno Edit<br>
During school breaks, he and Kirimaru live together in a rented house in the city. He often ends up helping Kirimaru with his part-time jobs, such as baby-sitting, selling food, etc. Like Kirimaru, he grew up without parents, and as such is sympathetic to him. Their relationship becomes an actual gossip subject between the Landlord and the Lady Next Door in episode 90 of season 19, in which they argue whether the two are father and son or brothers.</p>

<p>Denzou Yamada Edit<br>
In episode 90 of season 20, Doi explains to Ha class how he met the Yamadas: while in a mission six years ago, he got injured by the enemy and fell onto the Yamada's picnic place. Denzou protected him and the family treated him afterwards. He is pretty close with Denzou and his family because of that.</p>

<p>Kouji Makaino Edit<br>
Despite belonging to different, rival factions, the two teachers get along and help each other out when their students and their education are at stake.</p>

<p>Sonnamon Moroizumi Edit<br>
A ninja from Tasogaredoki who considers Doi his rival. However, Doi just considers him a nuisance, and easily defeats him by throwing school supplies at him.</p>

Shares a voice actor with Iruka from Naruto, and plays a similar role to him as well.
